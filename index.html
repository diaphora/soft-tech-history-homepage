<h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
	<p>I'm sure we've all heard of JavaScript, but I'm less certain about how many of us can answer the following questions:"What is JavaScript?" "What does JavaScript do?"   "What tasks can I use JavaScript to accomplish?"</p>
	<p>I hope this website can answer at least of those questions.</p>
	
&nbsp;

<h2>Purpose of JavaScript</h2>
	<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript">JavaScript allows websites to display dynamic content,</a> such as real-time blog updates, interactive page elements, or animated graphics, among a host of other possible applications.</p>

<h2>Some Uses of JavaScript</h2>
	<p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>Writing APIs (in combination with HTML5) to collect data on client’s geographical locations and device features</li>
			<li>Sever-side event loops using Node.js</li>
			<li>Open web sockets for always-on communication</li>
			<li>Client-side background data loading</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<h2>History of JavaScript</h2>

<p>Brendan Eich originally developed it while working with Netscape in May 1995 as a completely different language called "Mocha,"</a> but he and Netscape changed its name to JavaScript in December 1995 upon acquiring a license to support Java systems from Java's owner, Sun MicroSystems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">JavaScript's original purpose was simple: he designed a language that could be embedded into HTML,<a href="http://2ality.com/2011/03/javascript-how-it-all-began.html"> allowing web designers and Java programmers to incorporate Java components, like images and plugins onto their websites using JavaScript</a>.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Application to Websites As an Advancement from Print Media</h2>
<p>Among JavaScript's many abilities is changing the CSS data determining the HTML's presentation. While print media may require printing a second, large-text edition to accommodate the visually impaired, as you can see in action <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_style">here</a>.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Reaction of the Development Community</h2>
<p>Given JavaScript's potential for incporating Java components into online content, Ecma International, the standards-development body for information and communication systems, began developing their recommended standards for JavaScript in 1997. In 1999, they released ECMAScript 3, which established the foundations for modern-day JavaScript. <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rivals-set-their-sights-on-microsoft-office-can-they-topple-the-giant/">Ecma also standardized an Office Open XML format for Microsoft, which has become the default target file format for Microsoft Office</a>.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Conflicting Interests</h2>

<p>Following the release of ECMAScript 3, both Netscape and Microsoft began implementing proposals for future standards into their browsers. However, though Microsoft implemented some of these early proposals into their Jscript.net language, they later abandoned these efforts to implement core JavaScript features into Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Development in JavaScript returned from two years of stasis in 2005, when Brendan Eich re-joined Ecma with Mozilla. They began preliminary work on a new standards release alongside developers who had previously worked on Microsoft’s JavaScript research before moving to Macromedia. There they developed ActionScript 3, which became the source for the proposed ECMAScript 4.</p>
<p>However, industrial competition injected conflict into these efforts once more, as both Microsoft and Yahoo joined forces in 2007 to oppose the ECMAScript 4 standards development. Of course, the need to revise and modernize the standards of JavaScript remained, leading to proposals for ECMAScript 3.1, which would include regulations more accommodating to the proprietary languages of major corporations, though these proposals resulted in no major consequences.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Enter AJAX</h2>

<p>Nonetheless, open-source development communities with an interest in JavaScript arose around libraries like Prototype, jQuery, Dojo, and Mootools. These communities saw the potential for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to create client-side web applications that load data in the background, freeing the user from having to load an entirely new page, or affecting the display or behavior of an existing page. This was a major development in both Internet technologies, and signaled the advent of dynamic web content.</p>
<p>As the broader development community discovered the value of AJAX, the campaign to develop revised ECMAScript standards saw a revival. In 2008, developers met in Oslo to discuss ECMAScript 3.1 in terms of newer AJAX applications, which proved revolutionary enough in terms of standardization requirements that developers renamed it ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Following the release of the ECMAScript 5 standards, JavaScript has seen more server-side developments using the newly-developed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">Node.js</a>. Besides that, JavaScript can now use HTML5 in order to control user media, like re-sizing video for mobile displays.</p>
